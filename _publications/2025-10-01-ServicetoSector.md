excerpt: 'It is possible that early-adulthood volunteering may serve as a signal to locate workers who trend toward and thrive in such work. If further research validates this, practitioners could more easily locate individuals who preference a nonprofit setting by looking for such a signal. Alternatively, our findings may validate current practices that exist in nonprofit employment. '

Nonprofit, public, and private employees display theoretically and empirically distinct characteristics. An important branch of this research investigates differences in prosocial behaviors given a sector of employment, but findings often model prosocial habits as the outcome and rely on cross-sectional data. This study adds to extant literature by hypothesizing that early-adulthood volunteering serves as a pathway for emerging-career nonprofit and public employment. We utilize regression and duration analysis on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and find that millennials who display early-adulthood volunteering are significantly more likely to report emerging-career employment in the nonprofit sector. Furthermore, millennials with no work experience in nonprofits before their emerging-career phase demonstrate faster rates of entry into a nonprofit if they reported early-adulthood volunteering. We fail to find similar relationships for public employees. Our conclusions speak to the recruitment and retention of nonprofit employees while also providing possible caveats to understanding other-oriented public employees.
