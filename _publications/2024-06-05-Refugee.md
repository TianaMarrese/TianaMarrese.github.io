Nonprofit organizations are an important facet of civic life in US society as they provide critical infrastructure for enhancing civic engagement and directly supporting individuals and communities. In the United States, social care for refugees and immigrants is primarily the province of nonprofits. Our research explores the types of volunteers that assist refugees and immigrants in the US. We report findings from two independent yet complementary studies. Study 1 offers descriptive insight into the individuals who volunteered for refugee and immigrant organizations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, while Study 2 provides a deeper understanding of how individuals are attracted to this line of volunteering, including their perceptions of citizenship and social justice, their motivations, and what kept them engaged in volunteering.
