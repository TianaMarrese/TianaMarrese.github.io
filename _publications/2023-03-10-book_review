The Intersector: How the Public, Nonprofit, and Private Sectors Can Address America’s Challenges compiles interdisciplinary perspectives from more than 40 contributors to highlight the importance of cross-sector collaboration in tackling today’s societal issues. From hyper-local to cross-national challenges, editors Daniel P. Gitterman and Neil Britto recognize that modern problems are intrinsically connected across sectors. The multidimensional nature of these challenges implies a need for robust solutions that are necessarily conditioned on teamwork between the public, private, and nonprofit spheres.
