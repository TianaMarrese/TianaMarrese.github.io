I presented work by Dr. Femida Handy and myself on the relationship between volunteering and sector of employment. This study hypothesizes that early-career volunteering serves as a pathway for mid-career nonprofit and public sector employment. We find a strong relationship between early-career volunteering and nonprofit employment. Interestingly, similar results for public sector work are not observed.
