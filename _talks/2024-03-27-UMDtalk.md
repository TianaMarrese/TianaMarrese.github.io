I presented work by Dr.  Femida Handy and myself on the relationship between volunteering and sector of employment. This study adds to this literature by hypothesizing that early-career volunteering serves as a pathway for mid-career nonprofit and public sector employment. This relationship is investigated through logistic regression and duration analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort between 1997 and 2019. Results show that millennials with early-career volunteering are significantly more likely to report mid-career employment in the nonprofit sector, even when controlling for a robust collection of demographic and market factors. Interestingly, a relationship between early-life volunteering and mid-career sector of employment is not seen for individuals in the government sphere, suggesting important caveats to the public service motivation literature.
