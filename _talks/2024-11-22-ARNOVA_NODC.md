I collaborated with Dr. Jesse Lecy and Thiya Poongundranar to showcase improvements to the nonprofit sector open data infrastructure at the [2024 ARNOVA Conference](https://www.arnova.org/). My section of the workshop presented a case study narrating the various capabilities of the new infrastructure made possible through the investment of the National Center for Charitable Statistics and the work of Jesse and Thiya. You can check out the case study [here](https://tianamarrese.github.io/files/glass-cliff-workflow_final.html) and the Nonprofit Open Data Collective [here](https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/index).
