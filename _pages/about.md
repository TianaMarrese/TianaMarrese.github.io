I am an [assistant professor at Rutgers University - Newark](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/tiana-marrese) in the School of Public Affairs and Administration. The core of my work studies paid and unpaid (volunteer) labor public and nonprofit sectors. I am particularly interested in analyzing how and why individuals willingly engages in these sectors and I answer these questions through quantitative, macro-level analyses of publicly available data. Within my research, I focus on the implications of this behavior relative to market outcomes and its subsequent meaning for practitioners.

This primary interest is reflected in my current body of work. My research can be split into three separate but interrelated topics: wage differences, civic engagement patterns, and sociodemographic variations that arise between nonprofit and public workers relative to their for-profit counterparts. The photo above displays work from "From Service to Sector" in which I find a strong relationship between early-adulthood civic engagement and emerging-career employment in the nonprofit sector. This echoes a consistent finding across many of my papers in which I conclude that individuals engaging with the public and nonprofit sector are idiosyncratic entities that necessitate nuanced methodology. My results call for tailored recruitment strategies that bolster nonprofit and government human capital.
