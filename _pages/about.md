I am a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Social Policy and Practice. The core of my work asks how and why communities engage in prosocial behaviors across space and time. I am particularly interested in answering this question through quantitative, macro-level analyses that place an emphasis on paid and unpaid (volunteer) labor in the nonprofit sector. Within my research, I focus on the implications of this behavior relative to market outcomes and its subsequent meaning for practitioners.

This primary interest is reflected in my three-paper dissertation titled “Paid and Unpaid Labor in the Nonprofit Sector.” In this project, I investigate the three separate but interrelated topics of wage differences, volunteer patterns, and gender nuances that arise between nonprofit workers and comparable counterparts. The photo above displays work from Paper 2 in which I find a strong relationship between early-career volunteering and mid-career employment in nonprofit employment. A consistent finding across my papers is that individuals that engage with the nonprofit sector are idiosyncratic entities that necessitate nuanced methodology.
